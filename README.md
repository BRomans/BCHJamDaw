# BCHReaperOSC

Part of the **_BCHJam_** project.  
**_BCHJam_** that won the 1st place in the 2024 [br41n.io](https://www.br41n.io/) for the category BCI Programming & Arts.

This repository contains the audio effects part of the project.

The list of audio effects used (all gratis) are in `pluginlist.txt`.  

We used the Reaper DAW to host the plugins. The Reaper project file is `GuitarEffects-ReaperProject.rpp`.  

Finally, we used Open Sound Control (OSC) to communicate between the BCI and the audio effects.  The Pure Data patch `dummy_OSC_controller.pd` can be used to test the communication, simulating active and passive BCI signals.
